We are creating a very modern minimal web experience to communicate the Visualisation Team roadmap and have a few examples to bring it to life.

Below are the key points of the roadmap.

The style should be very modern and clean using geist design style and have dark/ligh mode toggle.

💡 Presentation Deck Structure: Customer Data Visualisation Roadmap (H2 & Beyond)
Slide 1 – Mission: The Why
Title: Our Mission: Turning Data into Customer-Centric Action

Content:

Build a connected, intelligent data ecosystem for the Customer team.

Give every user the right insight, at the right time, in the right format.

From journeys to segments, from analysts to execs — powering better decisions at every level.

Slide 2 – Where We Are Now
Title: From Foundation to Maturity

Content bullets:

Databricks migration in progress (complete Q3); unlocking scale and flexibility.

Power BI Apps adopted for better UX, governance, and dev-to-prod pipeline.

Automation now owned in-house, with built-in data quality checks.

OKR Dashboard and Exec Digest now live — setting the standard for targeted, user-first insight.

Slide 3 – Vision: Where We're Going
Title: The Future: Composable, User-Centric, Insight-Rich

Narrative:

“Imagine a world where…”

Analysts type bq.cust.journey(1234) to surface full journeys.

Execs get monthly digests that read like interactive articles, not spreadsheets.

CRM teams track campaign outcomes in real time, across channels.

Every team member, regardless of role, finds what they need — fast.

Guiding principles:

Composable: Reusable insight building blocks.

Flexible: Tailored to role and need.

Scalable: Works for 1 campaign or 100.

Trustworthy: Governance + quality by design.

Slide 4 – Q3 Roadmap: Focus Areas
Title: H2 Kick-Off: Big Leaps in Q3

🧩 Customer Dashboard – Phase 2
Targeted views for CRM, Loyalty, Insight, and CX.

Drill from segment-level to customer journeys.

Purpose: Clarity on “what’s happening” and “for whom.”

📊 Campaign Dashboard
One place for all campaign types + engagement data.

Purpose: Optimise channel mix and campaign design.

Decision support: “What works where, and for whom?”

⚙️ TP Connect Rebuild
Re-platform as Canvas App + Databricks backend.

Faster, more robust, scalable campaign ops.

🤖 Automation Maturity
Fully in-house, robust quality checks.

Reliable foundation for live reporting and decision support.

Slide 5 – Q4 & Beyond: Expanding Horizons
Title: Building the Future: Q4 and Strategic Investments

🧠 Data Science in Reporting
Model outputs (churn, HRHV, eligibility) embedded into dashboards.

Performance tracking layered into reporting.

Use case: Segment shift, risk monitoring, next-best-action.

🧱 Python API for Analysts
e.g., bq.cust.journey(1234)

Purpose: Lower barrier to advanced insight.

Outcome: Reusability, speed, analyst empowerment.

🗞️ Multi-Format Reporting
Power BI for slicing/dicing.

NYT-style exec summaries for narrative + impact.

“Medium meets user” → smarter consumption, better action.

🌐 Data Interface Evolution
“One-stop shop” for all customer data views.

Composable metrics, embedded commentary, smart search.

Vision: Ask a question → get an answer (not just a chart).

Slide 6 – Bringing It All Together
Title: The Super Reporting Suite: Unified, Composable, Powerful

Visual idea (describe or show):

One ecosystem → many tools:

Power BI Apps

Exec Digest

Campaign Dashboard

Customer Journey Explorer (via API)

Embedded DS Models

“Not a dozen dashboards. One ecosystem. Modular. Composable. Made for action.”

Slide 7 – What This Enables
Title: What Becomes Possible

Frame as “unlocks”:

📈 CRM optimises campaign design mid-flight.

🔍 Insight team explores drivers of segment growth.

🧰 Analysts build repeatable code without pipelines.

🎯 Execs scan KPIs and act — without filtering through reports.

“From reactive reporting → to proactive decision support.”
